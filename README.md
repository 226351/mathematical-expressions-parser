# Mathematical expressions parser
A really simple expression evaluator supporting the four basic math operations, functions, parentheses, and variables.

This is a tweaked version of a parser originally written by Blake O'Hare. You can find the original version [here](http://blakeohare.com/article/parsemathexpressionpython/).

## What does this tweak change?
You can now safely evaluate mathematical expressions including built-in functions such as `cos`, `sin`, `exp`, etc.

This is just a start. Please feel free to fork and pull requests!
